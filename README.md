fitWeird
========

A window monitor bookmarklet.

##Cool bookmarklet, bro, but what does it do?
fitWeird helps you add breakpoints when things get weird. It's about as dumb as it gets. Resize your window and it tells you the current dimensions in REM, PX and EM. No on&ndash;screen rulers, no typing a URL. Click the bookmarklet and a little doodad will show up in your browser. Bingo bango.

Great for debugging critical issues like "It looks weird on an iPad".
